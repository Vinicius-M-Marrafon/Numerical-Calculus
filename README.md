### Linear System solution with the Complete Gauss Method

#### Usage:
```console
~# make
~# cfgauss_completo.exe
```

<p>
  Before doing this project I tested the perfomance between Fortran and C to solve the some linear equations and Fortran was the winner! So, why not use it for do the calculations of the method <strong>Comple Gauss</strong>?
</p>

<p>However, the output format of Fortran lang. can be a little bit ugly, so a questian come in my mind. It's possible to compile both language? And the answer is YES!
